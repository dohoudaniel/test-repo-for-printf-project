This contains the resources and examples I found from the internet while making research.

Explanation on the example-of-the-printf-function:
From the example-of-the-printf-function, we used the following steps:
1. Create the function
2. Call your printf function using the main() function. Don't forget to return 0
//This is where the knowledge of Variadic Functions comes in
3. Initialize arguments into your function
4. Fetch and execute the arguments initialized in your function.
5. Close the argument list to necessary cleamup using 'va_end(arg)'. Don't forge to return something.
//We also used switch statements and variadic functions
